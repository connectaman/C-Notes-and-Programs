### C++ 

C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.

Our C++ tutorial includes all topics of C++ such as first example, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance, constructor, destructor, this, static, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, arrays, strings, exception handling, File IO, etc.

#### What is C++

C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.

C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object oriented programming used in C++ are:

   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation
   - Abstraction

##### Usage of C++
      
By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:
      
   - Window application
   - Client-Server application
   - Device drivers
   - Embedded firmware etc

```objectivec
    #include <iostream>  
    using namespace std;  
    int main() {  
       cout << "Hello C++ Programming";  
       return 0;  
    }  
```
