### C++ Structure

---

```objectivec
    #include <iostream.h>  
    #include<conio.h>  
    void main() {  
       clrscr();  
       cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming.";   
       getch();  
    }  
```

##### include<iostream.h> includes the standard input output library functions. It provides cin and cout methods for reading from input and writing to output respectively.

##### include <conio.h> includes the console input output library functions. The getch() function is defined in conio.h file.

##### void main() The main() function is the entry point of every program in C++ language. The void keyword specifies that it returns no value.

##### cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming." is used to print the data "Welcome to C++ Programming." on the console.

##### getch() The getch() function asks for a single character. Until you press any key, it blocks the screen.
