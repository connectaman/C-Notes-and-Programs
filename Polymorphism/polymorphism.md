### C++ Polymorphism

### Real Life Example Of Polymorphism

Let's consider a real-life example of polymorphism. A lady behaves like a teacher in a classroom, mother or daughter in a home and customer in a market. Here, a single person is behaving differently according to the situations.

##### There are two types of polymorphism in C++:

#### Differences b/w compile time and run time polymorphism.

|Compile time polymorphism	|Run time polymorphism|
|--------------|-----------|
|The function to be invoked is known at the compile time.|	The function to be invoked is known at the run time.|
|It is also known as overloading, early binding and static binding.|	It is also known as overriding, Dynamic binding and late binding.|
|Overloading is a compile time polymorphism where more than one method is having the same name but with the different number of parameters or the type of the parameters.|	Overriding is a run time polymorphism where more than one method is having the same name, number of parameters and the type of the parameters.|
|It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.|	It is achieved by virtual functions and pointers.|
|It provides fast execution as it is known at the compile time.|	It provides slow execution as it is known at the run time.|
|It is less flexible as mainly all the things execute at the compile time.|	It is more flexible as all the things execute at the run time.|
